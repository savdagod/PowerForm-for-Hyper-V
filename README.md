# PowerForm-for-Hyper-V
PowerShell tool mimicking Terraform to build, import or destroy Hyper-V VMs.

This project is a WIP. 

## Prerequisites
PowerShell v7 or higher

## Features
- Import a VM
- Change existing VM config

## Config file
Use the config file as a base. Currently there is no "required" varibles however that will be coming soon. You can configure multiple VMs in one file. 

## Why I made this 
The goal is to mimick how Terraform works without having to use the Hyper-V provider (which imo is lacking and requires setup). It allows me to automate my entire HomeLab build if I ever need to start from scratch. 

**More detailed documentation coming soon**
